Simple FIFO communication between cores of [Epiphany](http://www.parallella.org/) architecture.

I do rebase a lot, so there's no real code in master branch (default one). Instead, various implementation could be find in other branches, such as
*destinatnion-fifo*, *both-fifo*, and *double-buffer-per-port*.
